A reaction based, one to two player game


##Introduction and Concept of Game
This game originally was intended to be a *one* player game that would allow the person to test their reflexes and their judgement abilities. The gamer would be given a set of instructions, such as: "Only type the letters displayed in the RED squares". Following those instructions, a grid of squares would randomly change color and display letters, one by one. Each time a square would change it would only be for at most a few seconds. The higher level the shorter amount of time. If you typed a letter matching the letter on the right color of square, you would earn a point. Being able to find the letter on a matching square and also judge if whether you should press it, becomes a somewhat more challenging feat to accomplish, which is the basis of this game. As opposed to a lot of other games, this game does not have rules, so there isn't a lot of game logic in it, however, it does have logic in that it's a more intensive game to pay attention to. 

##Actual Result
Unfortunately, I realized that as I made my game there were quite a few things I still didn't take into account, such as the actual timing of all the events. How to establish an optional two player mode (since having two players or AI was a requirement of the project), and being able to insert breaks before rounds.
